		<p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empireâ€™s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. </p>

	<hr>
	<p>The boxes below are stack on each other. The order is called a bubbling order, because an event bubbles from the innermost element up through parents, like a bubble of air in the water.</p>

	<p>Click below to see it bubble:</p>

	<div class="d1" onclick="highlight(this)">1  
	    <div class="d2" onclick="highlight(this)">2
	        <div class="d3" onclick="highlight(this)">3 
	        </div> 
	    </div>
	</div>

	<h4>Note:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The target remains the same, however "this" changes based on the bubble.</li>
		<li>"this" is also available as event.currentTarget</li>
		<li>Try out example 2 in the js</li>
	</ul>

	<hr>
	<h4>Summary</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Events first are captured down to deepest target, then bubble up. In IE9 they only bubble.</li>
		<li>All handlers work on bubbling stage excepts addEventListener with last argument true, which is the only way to catch the event on capturing stage.</li>
		<li>Bubbling/capturing can be stopped by event.cancelBubble=true (IE) or event.stopPropagation() for other browsers.</li>
	</ul>
